class HMM:
    """
    HMM - class for Hidden Markov Models, representing
    statistical properties of random sequences.
    Each sample in the sequence is a scalar or vector, with fixed DataSize.
    
    Several HMM objects may be collected in a single multidimensional array.
    
    A HMM represents a random sequence(X1,X2,....Xt,...),
    where each element Xt can be a scalar or column vector.
    The statistical dependence along the (time) sequence is described
    entirely by a discrete Markov chain.
    
    A HMM consists of two sub-objects:
    1: a State Sequence Generator of type MarkovChain
    2: an array of output probability distributions, one for each state
    
    All states must have the same class of output distribution,
    such as GaussD, GaussMixD, or DiscreteD, etc.,
    and the set of distributions is represented by an object array of that class,
    although this is NOT required by general HMM theory.
    
    All output distributions must have identical DataSize property values.
    
    Any HMM output sequence X(t) is determined by a hidden state sequence S(t)
    generated by an internal Markov chain.
    
    The array of output probability distributions, with one element for each state,
    determines the conditional probability (density) P[X(t) | S(t)].
    Given S(t), each X(t) is independent of all other X(:).
